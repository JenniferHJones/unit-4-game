## Crystal Collector Game

The computer selects a random number from 19 - 120 to display at the start of the game. The player's objective is to match their score to the display number by clicking on the different crystals that have randomly assigned values from 1 - 12. Clicking on a crystal adds its value to the player's score counter.

* If the player's score matches, a win is added to the total wins, the game starts over with the computer choosing new random numbers, and the player's score resets to 0.
* If the player's score is greater than the random number, a loss is added to the total losses, the game starts over with the computer choosing new random numbers, and the player's score resets to 0.
