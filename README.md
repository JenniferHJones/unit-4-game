## Crystal Collection

The computer selects a random number from 19 - 120 to display at the start of the game and selects four other random numbers from 1 - 12  that are assigned to four different crystals and kept secret from the player. Clicking on a crystal adds it's value to the player's score counter, so the player tries to match their score to the random number by clicking on the different crystals and observing the values associated with each. 

* If the player's score matches, a win is added to the total wins, the game starts over with the computer choosing new random numbers, and the player's score resets to 0.
* If the player's score is greater than the random number, a loss is added to the total losses, the game starts over with the computer choosing new random numbers, and the player's score resets to 0.
